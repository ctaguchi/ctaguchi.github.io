## About

I'm Chihiro Taguchi, a full-time language lover.
I'm a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://nd.edu), USA,
as part of the [Natural Language Processing group](https://nlp.nd.edu) led by Dr. David Chiang.

My name in Japanese is 田口智大, and roughly speaking, it's pronounced as /tágɯ̀t͡ɕì t͡ɕìçíɾó/ (á: high pitch, à: low pitch).
